        "This project involves the development of a Healthcare and Pharmaceuticals Industry-Specific Large Language Model (LLM) Bot, designed to provide accurate and contextually relevant medical information. The focus is on creating an intelligent conversational agent capable of answering queries about medicines, including their composition, uses, and side effects, thereby enhancing access to reliable drug-related knowledge.\n",
        "\n",
        "For data collection, a custom dataset was built by scraping the 1mg website, one of India’s leading online pharmacies. The dataset includes structured information such as medicine names, compositions, uses, side effects, and images. Example entries include widely prescribed drugs like Avastin 400mg Injection, Augmentin 625 Duo Tablet, and Azithral 500 Tablet. This ensures that the LLM Bot is trained on authentic, real-world pharmaceutical data, making it capable of addressing patient and healthcare-related queries effectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "A suitable pre-trained model from Hugging Face was fine-tuned using this dataset on Google Colab with T4 GPUs, within a feasible training limit of 25 epochs. Fine-tuning enables the model to become contextually aware of drug-specific information while maintaining general language understanding capabilities.\n",
        "\n",
        "The resulting LLM Bot can interact with users in natural language, providing instant answers regarding drug uses, side effects, and compositions. For instance, when asked “What are the uses of Avastin 400mg Injection?”, the bot can correctly respond with indications such as colon cancer, lung cancer, kidney cancer, brain tumor, ovarian cancer, and cervical cancer. Similarly, it can explain potential side effects like rectal bleeding, high blood pressure, or dry skin.\n",
        "\n",
        "The project is showcased through an explanatory video, demonstrating the bot’s ability to answer medical queries in a clear and user-friendly manner. This implementation highlights the real-world application of LLMs in healthcare, supporting both patients and professionals in quick access to trusted drug information. The work will be further extended in the Industry Immersion module through a research paper analyzing the role of LLMs in improving healthcare accessibility and pharmaceutical knowledge dissemination."

        "In the healthcare and pharmaceutical sector, access to reliable, easy-to-understand drug information is a persistent challenge. Patients often struggle to find accurate details about medicines—such as their uses, side effects, and compositions—while healthcare professionals face time constraints in addressing repetitive queries. Although online resources exist, the information is often scattered, unstructured, or too technical for general users. This gap can lead to misunderstanding of prescriptions, improper medication usage, and reduced patient confidence in digital healthcare solutions.\n",
        "\n",
        "To address this issue, there is a need for an intelligent conversational system that can provide instant, trustworthy, and contextually relevant information about medicines. By leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) fine-tuned on authentic pharmaceutical data (e.g., from trusted sources like 1mg), such a system can enhance patient awareness, reduce dependency on fragmented web searches, and assist healthcare providers in delivering better support."

        "This project successfully fine-tuned the Phi model on a specialized medical dataset using the Unsloth framework, with the primary objective of creating a highly accurate and accessible tool for determining the uses of various medicines. The fine-tuning process demonstrated the significant potential of small language models (SLMs) like Phi for domain-specific applications, proving that they can achieve high performance on specialized tasks without the extensive computational resources required by larger, general-purpose models. The use of Unsloth was instrumental in this process, as it provided an efficient and memory-conscious method for fine-tuning, making it feasible to run this project on consumer-grade hardware."
